    <h2>Research Goals</h2>
    <p>My research focuses on understanding bird diseases, their transmission, and impacts on populations. I aim to discover novel methods for preventing the spread of these diseases and improving bird health. Below are some of my key research projects:</p>

<!-- Key Research Projects -->
<section id="chapter3" class="section">
    <h2>Disease Ecology</h2>
        <p>Disease ecology is the result of interactions between hosts, pathogens, and their environments. This means that in cases where habitats are notably different, we should see an effect on the disease systems in those areas.</p>
        <p>My research examines how habitat changes correspond with differences in the diversity and prevalence of avian pathogens.</p>
        <p>As part of my Master's program at SFSU, I studied the diversity and prevalence of <i>Haemoproteus</i>, <i>Plasmodium</i>, and <i>Leucocytozoon</i> parasites in birds from Papua New Guinea to assess the effects of island biogeography.</p>
        <p>My current research examines how habitat fragmentation in the San Francisco Bay Area corresponds to differences in <i>Haemoproteus</i> and <i>Borrelia burgderfori</i>, the causative pathogen of Lyme disease. I am also examining how urbanization and local habitat characteristics correspond to the prevalence of haemosporidians in dark-eyed juncos across southern and central California.</p>

<section id="chapter2" class="section">
    <h2>Aging and Disease</h2>
        <p>Part of my doctoral research involves using epigenetics to develop a molecular clock for wild birds (dark-eyed juncos). These epigenetic clocks report on differences in DNA methylation between individuals as they age and can be especially valuable for monitoring a population. While novel in it's own right, I am then using this molecular clock to determine if infections by <i>Plasmodium relictum</i> result in a sudden increase in the age of birds</p>
        <p>Stay tuned for the manuscript!</p>

<section id="chapter1" class="section">
    <h2>The Microbiome and Disease</h2>
        <p>The gut microbiome is a complex system with a number of important biological functions. While we know the microbiome can shift in response to a number of stimuli, it is worth examining if this corresponds with how an individual responds to a pathogenic infection. My current research explores the gut microbiome of a bird species (dark-eyed junco) in response to infections by the malarial parasite <i>Plasmodium relictum</i>.</p>

    <h2>Additional Projects</h2>
        <p>In addition to my main research, I have contributed to several other studies: </p>
        <p>Currently under review: How feather macrostructures change in response to urbanization</p>
        <p>Previous publication: "Instructor Talk" of graduate teaching assistants</p>
        <p>Previous publication: Zebrafish model for Schwachman-Diamond Syndrome</p>
